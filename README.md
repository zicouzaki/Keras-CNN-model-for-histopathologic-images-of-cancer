# Keras-CNN-model-for-histopathologic-images-of-cancer

 classification of small pathology images, the train_labels.csv file provide the ground truth of each image, a positive label means the pressence of cancer
 a negative label means the absence of cancer tumor in the image. I tried to provide a simple and easy stater code for this work.
